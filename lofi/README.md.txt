# study lofi
#### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/DrDciJcOexU
#### Description: My project allows people to listen to lofi music from a list that I personally picked and study to the music while having a timer on the side to keep from losing track of time.
The timer can change transparency background to day (white) and night (black) to match the current time so less straint on the eyes when studying at different times. 

For the files I only had 3 files. 

index.html - This is the basic formatting of the entire project. This is what started everything and also got things to work properly. Had to define certain ids and label the corresponding element 
to the same element or different one to get them to work. If one was messed up it would usually be because of this and there were many times where I had thought a bunch of the errors and problems for 
display were in the css file (usually is) but in fact it was because I had too many complexity in the html file. I wanted to do more but it just mess up the entire thing and I would have to revert 
back to what was working prior and start over.

script.js - The codes in this file were to activate and have the lofi player and time working properly. I had to play around a lot and try to fix them in this file so that the music plays or the 
timer starts ticking and counting the time, changes settings, etc. It's where most of the hardwork goes because without this file nothing would work. But after solving and figuring out what was 
needed for the lofi player or timer to work I didn't really have to touch the js file as much because I just had to worry about the design afterwards.

style.css - For the design on the lofi player, the timer, and the gif background. The codes used were to customize to fit the gif lofi background so that it blends perfectly and doesn't look 
too out of place so I coded a bunch of the design to the background in mind. This was where I spent most of my time because I wanted the design of the background, lofi player, timer, position, etc. 
all a certain way and to do so I needed to keep coding back and forth in this file to figure out what was needed to get the result I wanted. If I wanted to add more things I'd have to implement 
them into the html file, then if it was something that had to be interactive I would then proceed to the js file but that was rarely the case because everything else was in the css file.

I really like the design of the lofi player and timer but I hope that I could have done more. I actually wanted to make the whole project an application and have more interactive options like 
having sound effects in the background if the listener wanted to just listen to nature or sound effects and not the lofi music. I only listed 24 songs, which I could have added more but chose not 
to keep it on the simpler end. There wasn't a lot I could have done actually because the background is a gif and I actually wanted to make my own personally where the background of the gif or image 
itself could have been changed. I can change the gif background but that would mean positioning and changing the color or transparency of the lofi player and timer to match the new background. For 
example, instead of creating a timer I could have just implemented that into the background and have a clock in the function or showinng inside the computer from the gif. There's so much I would 
change and redo because it actually isn't perfect to me.
